# Sinatra App

This was the first day we started to work with a ruby web framework.

Specs were to create some basic get routes. One route returns JSON.

'/' returns a simple about page
'/address' returns an address in JSON format
'/camel/write whatever you want here' will transform and return a camel case version of it

## Run instructions
Clone, and run the my_first_sinatra_app.rb. It's that simple :)
(and then access localhost/4567)
